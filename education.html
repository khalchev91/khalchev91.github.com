		<p align="left" >
			The current teaching paradigm is one that is not student centric any at all. It uses one teaching style to educate today's students. 
			There are several variations in a student's intelligence. These are some of them:<br/>
			<ol type="i">
			<i>
			<li>Linguistic - The ability to think in words and to use language to express complex meanings.</li>
			<li>Logical/Mathematical- The ability to calculate, quantify, consider propositions and hypotheses and perform complex mathematical operations.</li>	
			<li>Spatial- Ability to think in three dimensional ways, including imagery, objects in space. </li>
			<li>Bodily/Kinesthetic: Ability to manipulate objects and fine tune physical skills. </li>
			<li>Musical - Ability to distinguish and create pitch, melody, rhythm and tone. </li>
			<li>Interpersonal: Ability to understand and interact effectively with others. </li>
			<li>Naturalist - Ability to observe patterns in nature, identify and classify objects and understand
				natural and human made systems. </li></i>
			</ol>
			<br/>
			
			Due to the standardization of teaching throughout the schools it is most times hard to deliver the lesson to the students as they differ in understanding.
			A student who is strong in linguistics is going to be weak in logical/mathematical thinking and vice versa. Due to this a new teaching paradigm is needed to make it easier for students to understand what they're being taught.

		<a href="http://www.k12.com/"style="color:black">K12 learning</a> is a website that helps students learn a grade level's syllabus in an easier and more student friendly manner.
		It uses graphs, pictures,videos and short exercises at the end of each chapter to help the student grasp the concept much quicker.
		This is an upcoming technology coming to displace the usage of textbooks. Using this technology it would be easier for students to learn the concept.<br/> More can be seen by clicking examples below.
