		<p align="left">
		Technology is considered to be the driving force of advancements in the healthcare industry. Because of it the Health industry has come a long way.
		 There are various technologies that caused a change in the industry.
			<ol type="i">
			<i>
			<li>
			mHealth: Mobile health is freeing healthcare devices of wires and cords and enabling physicians and patients alike to check on healthcare processes.
			Smartphones and tablets allow healthcare providers to more freely access and send information. 
			Physicians and service providers can use mHealth tools for orders, documentation and simply to reach more information when with patients
			It has also become a tool that allows patients to become active players in their treatment by connecting communication with biometrics
			</li>
			<br/>
			<li>
			Wearable Technology: Wearable medical devices and sensors are simply another way to collect data
			sensors and wearable technology could be as simple as an alert sent to a care provider when a patient falls down or a bandage that can detect skin pH levels to tell if a cut is getting infected.
			</li>
			<br/>
			<li>
			Remote Monitoring tools: Monitoring patients' health at home can reduce costs and unnecessary visits to a physician's office.
			An example is a cardiac cast with a pacemaker automatically transmitting data to a remote center. 
			It's basically allowing other people to monitor your health for you. 
			It may sound invasive but is great for patients with serious and chronic illnesses
