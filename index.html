		Disruptive Technology is a theory that explains the situation in which an 
		  innovation changes an existing market or sector by introducing 
		  simplicity, convenience, accessibility and affordability. 
		  This starts off in a market that appears as an unattractive or inconsequential to industry incumbents or the businesses ahead in the industry.   
		Although it seems like this, the new product or idea eventually redefines the entire industry.
			
		<br/><br/><br/>
		
		A popular example of a phenomenon of disruptive technology is in the computer industry back in the 1970s. 
		Back then the personal computers weren't really a thing as the cheapest computer available to a regualr civilian cost around (US)$200,000 and required engineering level of intelligence to operate.  	
		Apple came into the picture and started off small with children computers and although inferior to the minicomputer of the era it was much better than nothing. 
		The company continuously improved their computer until it broke out into a huge new market and eliminated the previous industry.
		<br/><br/>
		<br/><br/>

		There are several industries in which the theory of disruptive technology applies.
