		Using games to teach a particular lesson is much easier than sitting down and not interacting with the class and just reading and explaining.
		These games can range from exploring career paths to teaching a lesson that is very hard to grasp.		
		
		</p>
		<h4 style="color:blue">Using video</h4>
		<p align="left">
		Using a video to make a topic look simpler to a student is the way to go. If the teacher can't explain something properly for the student to understand the topic then using a video works.

		Your video doesn't support this tag
		</video><br/>
		This is a basic physics lesson that can be presented in a physics class or when a student doesn't understand something.
		</p>
		<h4 style="color:blue">Cloud learning</h4>
		<p align="left">
		Cloud based learning is another good technology. Not all times a teacher or student can make it to class for various reasons.
		This can go as far as having a live video call with the teacher or by having notes available for the student on a cloud based server.
