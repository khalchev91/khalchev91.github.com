		<p align="left">
		The way in which candidates campaign for different things whether to run for congress or to run for president has changed a lot since the last few elections.
		Let's take this election for example. Different methods have been used by various candidates whether by going out and campaigning or by the use of social media. The use of social media is a great tool to the candidate whether against them or for them.
		They use crowdfunding to make money for their campaign and you have people putting in a lot of money for the campaign. This goes to show the power of social media in the case of a general election.
		 Using social media and online crowdfunding would take reduce the time the candidate has to spend walking around asking for votes and holding press conferences which would reduce the money spent on physicsl campaigns.

		<h4 style="color:blue" id="security">Security</h4>
		<p align="left">
		The security of the government has improved since 9/11 but has also gotten more expensive. 
		Despite very tight security in all aspects of the public sector there will always be security breaches whether the government likes it or not.
		The government has the ability to find security breaches before the public finds out.
		Security also involves the protection of law abiding citizens. Although this is a serious problem currently when it pertains to minorities, it is still a lot better than what it was decades ago.
		Police walk with body cameras and dashboard cameras in order for anything that goes wrong footage recovered can either set the officer free or detain him.
		This gets rid of the police filing reports which can be lied on in order for them to keep their job or the suspect to lie to get away.
		</p>
		
		<h4 style="color:blue" id="petition"> Petition</h4>
		<p align="left">
		The ability for a city to hold online petitions to pass a law is a very good thing as it allows for less money to be spent on printing papers and then to go from door to door. This would reduce the amount of money spent by the city.
		This would be able to reach majority of the population as most of the population has a device that is capable of accessing the internet.
