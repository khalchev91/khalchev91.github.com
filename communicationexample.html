		<p align="left">
		Social Media has changed the way people communicate with each other. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram just to name a few are the type of social media sites that allow for people to post images and to share their interests with their friends in the case of Facebook and their followers in the case of Instagram and Twitter.
		This replaces having to wait till the next time you see a friend to tell them about something you saw and vice versa.
		</p>
		<h4 style="color:blue" id="instant">Instant Messaging</h4>
		<p align="left">
		Through Instant messaging people have been able to talk to someone instantly without the need for calling them. This is replacing the need for calling someone just to say a few words to them. Examples of these Instant messaging apps include WhatsApp and Google's newly released Allo app.
		</p>
		<h4 style="color:blue" id="data">Big data and analytics</h4>
		This is the term used to describe the way in which companies like Facebook and Google link your searches and interests to ads. By doing this it's easier for companies to find more customers particularly customers who are more interested in their product. Also this is useful for an upcoming company to advertise their product or service in that industry.
