As far as the eye can see every Goverment around the world are neck high in debt and the country's taxpayers are suffering either through decline in public services or through paying more taxes in order for the government to maintain the quality of the public services.
The costs for living in the US have increased particularly in the public sector which is operated by the Goverment.
The costs for higher education has increased 10 fold over the last few years. Health care has also increased and the cost for middle school has increased as well. The costs for security and defense has increased since the case of 9/11.
<br/>
Despite the government innovating basically everyday, its version of innovation isn't oftenly disruptive like in other industries like the computer industry.
The Goverment's kind of innovation involves their kind of technology being evolved overtime instead of being replaced by something else. This is known as sustaining innovation.

The way in which candidates <a href="governmentexamples.html#campaign" style="color:black">campaign for elections</a>, the way in which the government gets <a href="governmentexamples.html#security"style="color:black">security</a> and <a href="governmentexamples.html#petitions" style="color:black">petitions</a> for a law to be changed and so on.
	
There are a few upcoming technologies that are going to change the way the government works.<br/>
